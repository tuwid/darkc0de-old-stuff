Libdisassembly is simply a python library for disassembling x86 opcodes. It has been made for Immunity's PDB Project (a vulnerability development focused debugger), and is partially based on mammon libdisasm opcode list (http://www.eccentrix.com/members/mammon/). There is still a lot of work to do with the Metadata, but the library tries to return as much information it can get off of an opcode.

USAGE:

ie: 
   $ objdump -x /bin/cat | grep .text
     11 .text         00001e48  08048b00  08048b00  00000b00  2**4
   $ ./disassemble.py /bin/cat 0xb00 0x1e48

Disassembling file /bin/cat at offset: 0x2816
 00002816:   mov           0x8(%ebp),%edx
 00002819:   mov           0xc(%ebp),%eax
 0000281C:   mov           %edx,(%esp,1)
[...]

LIBRARY USAGE:
 Getting the string information of an opcode is really simple:
 
from disassemble import *
data="\xeb\xfe"
p=Opcode(data)
print p.printOpcode("AT&T")

The output would be:
 jmp         0xfffffffe

If for example, we want to put that information in a fancy GUI, we could request for a string separated in mnemonic, source, dest (or dest, source) with getOpcode(FORMAT).

 p.getOpcode("AT&T")

and it will return a table:
['jmp', '0xfffffffe']

Metadata info:
~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~
Every opcode has 3 variables: opcode, source, dest.

 - opcode, is the string of the mnenonic 
 - source, is an object or None
 - dest,   is an object or None

There are 3 types of objects,  Register, Address, SIB and Expression. There are a couple of common methods you can use:

 - object.printOpcode(FORMAT), the string representation of the object.
 - object.getSize(), size 
 - object.getType, information of the opcode table.
 - object.getSFlag, object permission ("R"ead, "W"rite, e"X"ecute)
 - etc (You can browse the source to get more information)
